# Space-invaders

Space Invaders is a 1978 shoot 'em up arcade game developed by Tomohiro Nishikado. It was manufactured and sold by Taito in Japan, and licensed to the Midway division of Bally for overseas distribution. The idea for this proejct is from the orginal game itself. i have made some alterations to the game. However the basic gameplay is the same from 70s shoot. All the images i have added in this project is from internet. Keep in mind if your forking the proejct and trying to make it yourself, you may have to adjust the images according to the screen setup you are making.
